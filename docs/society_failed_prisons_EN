The Dual Cost of the Punitive System: When Prison Fails, Society Pays

Introduction

A common argument in public discourse, often associated with human rights groups and
left-leaning politics,asserts that individuals who turn to crime are mostly victims of a
system that denied them opportunities. The central critique is that the State punishes
rather than rehabilitates, creating a cycle of recidivism. While the prison system&#39;s failure in
social reintegration is undeniable, the narrative that attributes criminality exclusively to a
&quot;lack of option&quot; ignores a crucial element: the social and economic burden that falls on the
ordinary citizen, who is repeatedly victimized by this unresolved equation.

The Fallacy of &quot;No Choice&quot; and the Allure of Illusion

It is a fact that millions of low-income Brazilians live honestly, facing the barriers of limited
opportunity daily with hard work and dignity. Arguing that crime is an inevitable
consequence of poverty is, at the very least, an oversimplification that disrespects the
integrity of these citizens. What attracts many young people to drug trafficking and other
illicit activities is not just survival, but the allure of fast money, ostentation, and adrenaline,
a promise of power and status that formal work rarely offers. Ignoring this component of
&quot;choice&quot; in favor of the illegal path is turning a blind eye to a fundamental dimension of
criminal psychology.

The Citizen as a Multiple Victim of the System

This is the core of the problem: the law-abiding citizen is hit not once, but multiple times by
the system&#39;s inefficiency.

Direct Violence: The first and most traumatic blow is being a victim of robbery, theft, or an
act of violence. It is the physical and psychological aggression, the loss of property, and in
many cases, the loss of life or loved ones.

The Financial Burden: After being victimized, the same citizen, through their taxes, is
forced to pay for the perpetrator&#39;s stay in jail. The cost is astronomical. According to
DEPEN (the National Penitentiary Department), Brazil has a prison population of over

835,000 inmates (2022 data, the most recent consolidated). The average cost to maintain
an inmate in the system varies greatly, but conservative estimates point to around R$
2,500 per month per prisoner. In some states, like São Paulo, this cost can exceed R$
3,000. When multiplied, this represents an annual cost to public coffers, and therefore, to
taxpayers, that exceeds billions of reais.

Recidivism and the Vicious Cycle: The third strike occurs when the inmate is released.
Without professional qualifications and, often, with stronger ties to crime after experiencing
the overcrowded, gang-dominated system, they return to the streets. The statistics,
although debated and varying according to the source and methodology, point to an
alarming scenario: it is estimated that the recidivism rate in Brazil could exceed 60%, with
some studies suggesting even higher figures. The individual who &quot;had no choice&quot; leaves
prison even less prepared, and society becomes a target again, restarting the cycle of
violence and costs.

For a Solution That Relieves the Citizen&#39;s Burden

The discussion, therefore, needs to evolve. It&#39;s not just about improving education in the
long term, a noble goal, but one with delayed effects. It is urgent to debate how to
transform the prison system from a bottomless pit of expenses into a self-sustaining unit
that, at the very least, does not further burden its primary victim.

A viable proposal, already partially adopted within the system, is prison management by
private entities, under strict state supervision. In this model, inmates would be required to
work full-time. The production generated in the penitentiaries would be used to cover their
own maintenance (food, security, infrastructure), vocational training courses, and also a
compulsory savings plan to be accessed upon release.

Conclusion

The central idea is simple yet powerful: the prisoner must support themselves. It is neither
fair nor sustainable for the worker, who has already suffered direct violence, to have their
income further penalized by taxes to indefinitely support the one who assaulted them.
Transforming prison into an environment of mandatory work and learning is not an
inhumane measure; on the contrary, it is a way to restore the inmate&#39;s dignity through labor

and the prospect of a different future. By doing so, the cycle of state dependency is
broken, and the dual burden, moral and financial, that currently crushes the true engine of
society, the law-abiding citizen, is alleviated.
